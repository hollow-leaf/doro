### Why use PWA
### Compatibility with o1js and Mina-Signer
ï¼·e were using o1js for the front-end, and surprise, it didn't play nice with our contracts on mina. It's also a challenge for me, a backend dev to wrote whole frontend ðŸ˜­(Maybe I will call my teammate back to help this project) Things were just not smooth sailing. Enter mina-signer, a supposedly lightweight key framework. PWA swoops in to save the day, making sure our contracts finally get the VIP treatment they deserve. Now, we're happily generating private keys locally, storing them in a serverless vault. Security upgrade, check! But we just push a template now, please see the properly work in March.

### Mobile Dreams and QR Code Magic
Our grand plan? Make our app the POAP cousin, you know, QR codes for event entries and lottery hype. But here's the catch â€“ we're torn between pushing transactions straight from the front or letting the backend do the heavy lifting. Any wise suggestions on this front are more than welcome. Still Planning now..

### NFC and the April Deadline

NFC is the cool kid on the block, and we're eyeing it for our April extravaganza. Picture this: easy-peasy privacy-focused lottery draws without hassling users to install a mina wallet. PWA, in all its glory, plays nice with web-nfc. It's like they were meant to be together.

### Wrapping it Up
So, PWA steps onto the stage, saving us from compatibility nightmares, bringing our mobile dreams to life, and paving the way for NFC magic. React Native temporary stop researching; it's the unsung hero of our decentralized dreams â€“ simple, secure, and ready for whatever we throw its way. Cheers to PWA! ðŸš€
